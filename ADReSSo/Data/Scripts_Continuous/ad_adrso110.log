Can you tell me everything you see going on in the picture? The girl down below the boys up there is as a cookie jar up here. He's putting cookies in and the things followed over. Then there is, the lady Jesus, his washing dishes and drying them in a sink, turned down in the waters, running down and running on a floor, and she's standing in the water. She's got AA dress on and she's looking at her past rates down here. She's looking out to the window. Looks like that boy's gonna fall over pretty soon. Okay.
