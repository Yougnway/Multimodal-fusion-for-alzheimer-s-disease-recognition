The little boy is up on the stool, taking cookies, handing them down to his sister, and she's telling him to be quiet and stool is tipping over. The mother is washing or drying dishes. The water is ringing into the sink and running over down onto the floor. The wind must be blowing because the curtains look like their indoor. The cabinet door is open. Mothers standing in water. That's it very good.
