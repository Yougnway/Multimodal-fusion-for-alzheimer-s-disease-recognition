I want you to tell me everything that you see going on in, this picture, everything that you see happening here. Go ahead.For one thing, the boy is stealing cookies, and the girl is asking for cookie, and the boy is standing on stool, which is being over. And the ladies drying a plate and the. Water is running in the sink and overflowing on the floor and getting her feet back. And the window is open. I don't know if there's anything special going on outside the window. Seems to me that's essentially the things that are going on in this picture. And the girl is picking her nose, the boys, an di ng or cookie. Really? Those are the only activities I see.okay?
