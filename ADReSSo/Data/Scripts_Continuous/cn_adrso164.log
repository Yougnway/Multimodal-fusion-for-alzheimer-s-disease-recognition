The mother is washing dishes. She's drying the dishes and letting the water keeping and keep on running in the sink. And the water is running over, and she's standing in the same in the water. It's running over. There's a window. There. She's looking at at the grass and the flowers. And the curtains seem to be shaking from the wind and the air that's blowing in the dishes that she's threw. Drying are sitting on the sync. Top the little girls raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie. And he has one cookie and his hand, and he's going after another one. And it's ready to hand her. Hurt cookie. Mother is holding a dishcloth. She's drying the dishes when she has flattered, she's drying. Okay? Seen again reaction. Bye.
