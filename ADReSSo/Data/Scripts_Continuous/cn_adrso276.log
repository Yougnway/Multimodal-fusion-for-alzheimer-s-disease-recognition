Now it's the same picture. You should give me a different one. Great, too. Why you need to be more fun if you had some variety. That's a picture, okay? We have here a scene in the kitchen and it looks as though that's a mamma who is working at the sing and her two children. The two children are hoping that mamma will not notice because she's looking at the window that they are getting into the cookie jar. So the boy cl im BS up on a stool to reach the cookie jar. And as you getting up there, the tool of the stool is tilting and he looks as though he were about fall over. The little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips. He has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one. The lid is off the cookie drawer. The covered door is open. He's supposedly going to hand one cookie. It looks as though he is to his sister and grab another one for himself.But I doubt he's going to, get all that done before the stool falls over on the other, around the corner of the kitchen. There's a counter that sort of turns a corner. There are cupboards below the condor and above the condor where the cookies are. Then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen, you have base cabinets, and then you have a window above that, which is looking out into something which makes it look.So at summer outside, because the window is open, there are things growing out there. There's a walk, there's a some shrubbery underneath another window that looks. It's in another wing of the house. There's a tree beyond. There are tied back curtains, the window. The mother is working at the sink and the faucet is left on. And apparently there's no overflow in the sink. So it's overflowing right onto the floor splice spice. And she has on a slingless dress, which also indicates that it's summer it looks. So she has an apron on. She has short hair. She is drawing a dish with at towel, a plate with at towel.Besides the sync, there are 2 cups on a plate. Books. Are there some sets and some dishes in the sink? And two faucets with x type handles one on either side and the center faucet. She has shoes on with no ties to sort of slip on shoes. There's a little golf balance across the Top of the curtain. I think that's all I'm gonna tell you. It handles on the door are the kind. They're just almost like a round piece of wood that you have to get a hold of to pull the covered door open. What's really strange is that can't see any handles on the cupboards on the other side of the. Okay.
