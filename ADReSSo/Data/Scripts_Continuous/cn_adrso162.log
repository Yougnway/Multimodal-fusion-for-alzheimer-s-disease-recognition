Here's the picture. Mother is drying the dishes. The water is flowing out over the sink under the floor. It's a pretty day at time. Lots of flowers. There are three dishes left, wash. She's standing in the water. It's dangerous. The children are getting into the cookie jar, the boys out there in the store the Thomas already. It's got one cooking and he's getting a little girl, he's getting another cookie join. Did you say actions for her? A little girls kind of looks like she's trying and eat it to be quieter? She's laughing, thin. Much attention. She looks like water is splashing onto the floor. Is it?
