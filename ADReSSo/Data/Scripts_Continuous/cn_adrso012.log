I see a kitchen and a housewife or homemaker at the sink. Her two kids uh are having a great time. She is drying a dish as her sink overflows. She must be blind, but that's her doing. Also, the kid is a proud to fall. Having un su CC es sf, ul ly help successfully gotten a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's the boy who's upon a stool and the daughter. Is there trying to grab the cookie, I guess, from the boy, what else it looks like a nice yard and back with AA bit of a garden, some grass. I believe she's standing in the water. It's still bothers me that she's gone blind, but she can't, she'll feel its own on her feet. When the water hits her, that's what I see.
