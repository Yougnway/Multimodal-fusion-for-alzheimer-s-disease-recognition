All the action you see going on in the picture, honey, I would have had it was in the kitchen, and I was the oldest ten. If we made a mess like that, you'd get a kick in the air. I want you to tell me all the actions going on that. We have fill into the water. And the kid when its cookie jar and a stool is turned over the mother's running the water on the floor. And what else you want from that? Looked like somebody's laying out in the grass. Doesn't it? The kid in the cookie jar and a tilted stool. But more do you want the water rolling on the floor?
