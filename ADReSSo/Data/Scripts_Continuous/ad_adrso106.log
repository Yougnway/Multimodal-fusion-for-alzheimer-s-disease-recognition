What's going on in a picture? The waters are running out over the thinking of this. The little boys going up into the cookie jar, but he's on the Top of the chair that he's gonna fall off since it's tipping over out of the water. That's on this also on the floor that's coming out of the sink and one thing. Let's see on the water here and that it goes all way down into this kitchen floor, the boy and cooking out of a cookie jar, but steps back on the chair, whatever, focused the table, not a table, get to the Top of the crook, up of, the drawer. That's about all, that's fine.
