This doesn't matter where you start all right. All right. There's a a little boy on a step store which is tilted, and he's getting some cookies. Now you want descriptive as far as the he lives or how they are or just the action and looks like trying to hand a cookie to his sister, kind of has her finger up towards your mouth. Like she might be GI gg, li ng, the mother's drying dishes, but the water is over flowing onto the floor. I'm gonna sell the same book like it's almost tilted now. We should call the the salt the cup of the saucers. That's not action. I lose it. No, you don't the breeze might be blowing, the curtains look like they might the outdoor and see. That's all right, I guess.
