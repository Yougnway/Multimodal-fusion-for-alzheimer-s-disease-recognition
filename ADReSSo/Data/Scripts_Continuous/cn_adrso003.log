Are starting from the left, I see two children standing on a tipping stool, reaching for the cooking jar. The boy is up on the Top of the stool, obviously getting the cookies for the little. His younger sister. Mom is washing the dishes while the sink is overflowing or drive what doing the dishes and not really sure what's going on out there out on the other side of the window. There's some dishes there on the sink that remained to be done.
