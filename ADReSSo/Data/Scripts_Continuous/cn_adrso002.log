I see a mom doing the dishes and the waters overflowing from the sink, and she seems to be completely oblivious of it. The children in the picture who I presume are hers, are climbing one, the boys climbing on a or standing on a stool that's about to fall over. Putting his hand in the cookie jar on the Top shelf and his sister or cousin or whoever the girl is, is reaching up for a cookie. The window is open. There's a pathway with garden on either side it looks like there's something else on the sink, I on the counter Top dishes and that the mother has an apron on. She is dressed in the missus beaver style with the vary with an apron, a nice truss and shoes and so forth. And I don't understand why she's not turning the water off, but that's part of the deal. And there's curtains on the window and there's pains in the window, small pains. Let's put it.
