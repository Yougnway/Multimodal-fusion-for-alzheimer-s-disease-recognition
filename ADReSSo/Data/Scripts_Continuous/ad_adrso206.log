Just tell me everything that you see happening in the picture a. Little girl and the little boys getting back the jar. And the stool is upsetting. And I guess the mother is drying dishes. Water, SP il li ng down all over this sink, water on the floor, the boy's gonna fall and that ear. So dark and lakes drying dishes and water forces on waters running all over the floor. What else am I surviving? What? Anything else? Just the things that you see happening. The cookie jar, the stole are doing the dishes. The water, SP il li ng. Take part of that as far as I.
