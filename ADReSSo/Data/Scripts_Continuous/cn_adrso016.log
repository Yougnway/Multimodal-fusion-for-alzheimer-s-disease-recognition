A lot of fall and safety problems. This boy is getting cookies, my cookie jar and to the still is tipping. Not sure what his sister is doing. I think she just wants a cookie, but the mothers not paying attention to the water falling out of sink. And she's drying dishes. So not sure and she's gaining water and there's a nice window. I don't see anything much else going.
