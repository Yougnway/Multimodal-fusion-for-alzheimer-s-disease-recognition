I'd like you to do here. Take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see happening. Everything that you see going on. Can I start the children are getting into the cookie jar, which is on the high above the sink. They have lit off the cookie jar. The boy has two in his hand and the girls reaching up for them, and the two in which he stands about to upset, push doors open into to get the cook a jar. The mother presumably is that the sink, washing and dishes and a sink is running over the water, splashing down on the floor.There are two, I suppose, dry dishes on the sink. She has one in her hand to plate that she is drying. She has on apron. To stand by. The sink is below a window with a path out into a garden. There are the shrubbery to the left of the path. And you can see beyond that, another window. I know what that is, rhythms of flowers who reads. And no, this is part of the harsh you can see the work out. Maybe in all the house and the curtains gone back.
