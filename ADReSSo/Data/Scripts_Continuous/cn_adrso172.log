Here's the first part. Sink is overflowing. Mother is washing dishes or an adult is washing dishes. There are two children in the cookie jar when I was on a stool and the stalls overturning. The little girl is reaching for a cookie from the little boy as the stool turned falls over. There is a window and the pushes and path outside the window in the glimpse of another window. In another part of the house or curtains with tiebacks or dishes, dish tiles or dish tiles. But now maybe this is only one dish style. I thought I said, no, 2 cups, plate, cabinet, apron, grass and trees, and picking floor outer space. Good nightmare.
