I see what seems to be a mother or could be a babysitter with two children, a boy and a girl. The kids are after the cookies and the little boy is gonna hurt himself really badly. The mother isn't not too good to shape either because there's water SP il li ng out of the sink. And if her feet are going to get wet, she could slip, she could break the dishes. You'd really hurt herself a little girl. I think she's safe enough, though, looks like she's a little worried, beautiful day. Windows are open, the Britons are. That's not so windy because the cousin seems to be in place. Other than that, it seems a very sweet home, probably a little, few years ago, not right now.
