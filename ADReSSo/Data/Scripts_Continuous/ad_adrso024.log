It's a cookie jar and the lid resolve the cookie jar. The boy is about to. Come down on the floor. Bye. Housewife in the kitchen. Sync is overflowing. Byebye. The girl may be saying, say, ha ha, I told you some of hers. I guess this must be the wife, although might not be, because maybe that was an apron and um. Maybe this should be a window. There, yeper. What is there? And as a pathway, we don't know where the pathway is going to, because we can't see it on below. And looks like there's some flowers in the bushes or something like that. And here are some graperies. This one in on this side is, I don't see it the other side, but I suspect it would be the same thing there. And the I guess I said the water was coming down on the floor. I don't know they here are too cup cups for coffee or something like that. Hi, thank you very much. Indeed.
