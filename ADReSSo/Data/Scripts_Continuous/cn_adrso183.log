I want you to tell me everything you see happening in that picture. Everything was going on there. The boy is reaching into the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. The little girl is reaching for a cookie. Mother is drying the dishes, the sink is running over. Mother's getting her feet wet. They all have shoes on. There's a cup, 2 cups and a saucer on the sink. The window has drawn withdrawn grapes. You look out on the driveway. There's kitchen cabinets. What's happening? Mother is looking at the window, the girl is touching her lips. The boy is standing on his right foot. His left foot is sort of up in the air. Mother's right foot is flat on the for her lefties on her left toe. She's holding the dishcloth in her right hand and the plate. She is drying in her left. I think i've run out of it.
