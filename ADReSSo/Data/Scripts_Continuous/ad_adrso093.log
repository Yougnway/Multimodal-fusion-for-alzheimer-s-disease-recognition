Tell me what's going on in that picture. This little boy, this little girl's talking to this boy up upon to up upon this tu PP er ladder. And she's asked him to bring some of this down or whatever it was a jar or whatever it is that the dozen doesn't break. There's a mother over here. She's watching them that she has that break at her and hand. And it looks like it's very strong, brake her. She's looking real good at it the, jar or whatever she's touching. Given the little patch of her mouth of a less toughness there, anything else? Canada, it looked like. He's gonna bring some of that down for them, all the and mothers out there looking at him and looks like she's washing this dishes that they already had it and she's washing the dishes away from them. And then looks that way. She's cleaning it.
