Our mother standing by the sink, kind of looks like lost and thought wiping a dish. The sink is overflowing with water. She doesn't seem too concerned. A boy is on a stool, it's about to dip. Tip over, he's in the cookie jar. His sisters got her hand up reached, look waiting for a cookie. The mother seems oblivious to what they're doing.
