My such a mess and that sink is overflowing. And I don't know why she's trying not even caring. She meaning that the wife or mother, while the kids are one of the kids is falling off the stool, big accident momentarily. It's possibly, she's looking out of the window. She doesn't look, she looks unhappy. She's got brown on her face and walking in the puddle of water that's coming out of the sink. That's really. Now it doesn't look like a terribly organized way of life. Here in this kitchen, the boy is going to fall on a ground and crash with some of the cookies will also come out onto the ground. There's something going on outside. There's not nothing serious, though, just the rest of the house and sidewalk as about all.
