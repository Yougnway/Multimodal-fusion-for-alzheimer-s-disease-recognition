Absolutely can hear you. There's the two children are in the process of stealing cookies from the cookie jar. The little girl has her finger up to her mats to be quiet. And they stool on which the boy is standing is about to fall. And the mother must be looking at the window because the sink is spelling over with water, overflowing with water. And meanwhile, she's drying the dishes. And the waters fallen ban onto the floor. And it's a nice day. The wind is up, but looks like it's a nice day outside. It's about all I can see on that. Okay.
