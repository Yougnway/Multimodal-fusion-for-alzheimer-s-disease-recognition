A little boy upon us on this thing here and it's bees up trying to get something out of gardens selection. I think it is. Little girl, I think, is mad because she didn't get some of it. And here's mamma drying the dishes. One. Anything else going on? No, just the little girl and the boy was on here. What else is, what's going on over here? The little girl and the boy. She's reaching up to the boy and the boy is. Got his other hand, down MHM. So anything else? No, that's all going on over here. Anything she spilled, something, I think from the sink down, came splashing down. That's the first day noticed. I'm terrible anymore. No. Good.
