It's AA kitchen scene and the mother is doing the dishes. Children are trying to get into the cookie jar. The stool is falling over, the water is running over in the sink. When it looks as though the window is open and their grass, what have you grasping trees outside? Look like the curtains might be billowing. A the little girl is asking the boy for a cookie and see the mothers drying the dishes. And she's standing in the water. Look like there. A couple dishes that have already been dried sitting on the sink. I guess that's all I see. Let's go on over here. Pardon me? Tell me this. Again. I read this. I said the little boys trying to get some cookies out of the cookie jar and little girls asking for a cookie in this dual looks as though it's going to fall over.
