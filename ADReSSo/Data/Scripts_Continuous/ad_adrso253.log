I'm boys trying to get some cookies and the girls holding her hand up, because he has gotten one and she wants it. And where he's climbing up is fallen over. And this girl, she's washing dishes. And she has a something there for the dinner. She spilt the water and saw on the floor going. As a dishcloth. In her hand. The boy, he's drawn to get the cookies out of the jar for her, but he's gonna fall over, by the way, the looks. Okay. She's built some water and stepping them. Okay?
