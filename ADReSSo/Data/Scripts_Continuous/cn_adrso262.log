Thank you, this one. The mother is wiping a dish at the sink. The water is overflowing from the sink. A youngster is about to fall off the stool, reaching for a cookie jar. And the little girl is holding up her hand to grab a cookie out of his hand. The window appears to be open. I can't make out any action in the background there. It's fun.
