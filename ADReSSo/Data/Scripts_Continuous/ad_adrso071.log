Going on in the picture. We got in the boys getting in the cookie jar and standing on a stool that is falling over. And his sister maybe is telling him to be quiet. So his mother won't seem. In the meantime, the sink is running over onto the floor. She's drying dishes, and um. There's something going on outside the window. I don't think it's what it is. She's drying dishes, but I don't get the connection between picture outside. I guess she's having her problems and they're having theirs.
