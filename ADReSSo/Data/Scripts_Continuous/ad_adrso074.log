I see two kids chart one on the stool, understanding on the floor have a door is opened. Mothers washing the distances, waters running of the following, the sink. And she kept and a plate on the counter. And she's washing, holding a plate in your hand. Curtains at the windows with the jar has a lit off. Let's find it. I would underneath the stink, I would underneath it. Other coverage, get falling off the stool. We're laughing in cookie, then the cookie jar with a little. He has the cookie in his hand. That's the same.
