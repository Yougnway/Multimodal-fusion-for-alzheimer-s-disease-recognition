What action do you see going on in that picture? You know, I see the mother washing dishes, see the water, blowing out, of a sink, tap. See the boy on a stool, it's about to tell all he's trying to get into the cookie jar. Little girl has her panda for cookie. Water is running, dishes around the sing Top. Then it's all Free job. And let me tell you the grass is growing, the water is going up, sink on, the end up to see the outside work.
