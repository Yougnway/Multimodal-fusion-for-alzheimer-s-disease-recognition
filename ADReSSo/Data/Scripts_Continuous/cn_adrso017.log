We have a few more paths to go through before we break for today. Okay? So here's a picture. Just tell me everything that you see going on in this picture.There's a guy up in the tree, and the dog is barking at the gulf. I'm sorry.I give you the wrong one. That was my fault. That was my fault. Okay? I'm going on the picture.I see a boy robbing the cookie jar and is apparently his sister wanting a cookie. But he's about to have an accident in the process of robbing the cookie jar. And I see the mother walking washing dishes and the sink over falling because she has the water on and the sink is full. She must have to stop her in place. She may be in danger of slipping since there's water on the floor. And the boys looks like I think I said that already, I think the boys about to him and to that. Okay.
