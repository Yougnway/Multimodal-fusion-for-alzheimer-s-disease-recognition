Then here and this one, tell me everything you see going on in this picture.Bail. I see the mother is not paying attention and her water is running over her sink. The boy has cloned up on a ladder to steal some cookies and he's falling over. Girl is laughing. The grass is growing outside. Nobody seems to care. They're just going on with their daily activities.Could anything else? You see? No right or wrong answers? But is there anything else you see going out in the picture? No. Not.Really.
