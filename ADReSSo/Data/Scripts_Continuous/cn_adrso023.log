Tell me everything you see going on in this picture. This one, a little boy six in a floor off a stool trying to get a cookie or his sister, I guess. And then the mother's washing dishes and her sink is running and and she's washing dishes.And Ryan is you see anything else going on? I there are no writer on answers. I just want to be tricky. You just the water, SP il, li ng in the floor and the little boy and girl, he speaks a far trying to get the cookies. They'd see anything going on outside.Thank you very much.
