Wish you make us laugh. Are you ready? Mhm. The sink is overflowing. Mother was standing in the water like a jerk. She's wiping the dishes also like a jerk there. The boy is trying to get a cookie out of the cookie jar, but boy, he's about to fall off the stool. His sister has her, has her hand a finger up to her mouth like she's saying shit. I told my mother know what you're doing, and he's about to hand her a cookie, but in a few moments is going to be like total catastrophe, whether the reason the water is flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously.I'm looking out to the window and I don't see anything going on out there. Unless I don't, that's just a bush. I'm presuming or a plum pudding. I told you the stool was about to go over anymore with this gonna be real chaos, which will make what's going on the picture. Look like nothing. The cookie jars full, the lid is off the cookie jar. The do you want me to tell you all those things. Tell me all the things you see going on. In the picture. The cabinet door has just swung open. St. Il ls about the fall. I guess i've told you that terrible crash mother is daydreaming. She doesn't even know what's going on behind her. I think that's very important. And sometimes typical. Mhm. Sister. But once.
