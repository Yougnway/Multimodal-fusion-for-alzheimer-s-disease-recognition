The sinks running over, waters gone all over. Here, the boy, the step ladders turn in under his legs. He's still in cookies, all the cookie jar. And she's dating for cookies, the girl. Coming back to the sink. Let's see here. I'm a Stephen in the water. I said the sink was running over. She's dry and dishes. When my heart began with it, there's something that I don't know it is written on month grass. It seems never noticed that I don't know and hurts. That's at tea. I don't see anything else there. She's stepped in the water, sick and over that spell something down there, but I can't get out so forth and he's on a, a stool that's gonna fall over only stealing cooking. There's a plate in 2 cups on the sink and she's got a plate in her hand. I don't see anything. Okay.
