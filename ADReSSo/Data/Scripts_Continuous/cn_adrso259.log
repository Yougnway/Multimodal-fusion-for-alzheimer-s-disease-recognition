Yes. Sure. I many are the mothers washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing? She has some of them, a dried already on the side is she's looking out the window. A little boy is falling off the stool as he's getting into the cookie jar to keep to his old sister who's reaching up to get the cookie. Also is water all over the floor. There's the garden is outside and the mother is not paying any attention to what they do. The stool is tipping. The cookie jar being doors open, the medical breeze coming in because the, this window is open. The little girl's saying has your finger to her mouth, we won't tell mother while you give me the cookie. It's in the kitchen and the 2 cups in the dish already have been the dried. And the mother stepping in the water and she's probably so engrossed in what she's doing outside. She neither knows what children are doing. Are she paying any attention that the water is overflowing? Okay. Good.
