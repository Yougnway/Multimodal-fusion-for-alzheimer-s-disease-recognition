Everything you see going on in this picture. Ground safety hazards as they referred to the military, the kid on the stool, it's about to fall and the woman sitting there blight blasei while her sink runs over on the floor. Let's see the little girl. But she asking for a cookie while her brother's falling down the stool that's about it. 222 accidents were happening in the middle of two accidents happening here. She's standing in water, so it's gonna be slippery. She's liable to besides the water running over the sink. Kind of funny, the way that sinks drawn, the way it looks like. It's all splicing over the front. I don't really see anything else in the picture of significance. Am I supposed to see something else in the picture of significant? None of those hidden things, I wear the faces in the corner. No. Looks like the typical council sketch, of uh, domestic scene where everything goes wrong.
