Look at that picture and tell me what you see going on an average home that looks very much like hours at many times. And the mother is, but she's filling her water, which is not very good, but she's doing washing dishes and drying them and one of the children up se TS cookie jar. And that's a very average thing to go in and out. Our home a it's a very active family. And so that it makes it kind of hard at our house sometime, because there's a lot of act, like I said, a lot of activity. You see anything else going on over here? The poor girl is still in the water on her feet is gonna be wet, but that she'll have to struggle with that. Also there are a few more dishes that didn't get finished. This has to be the dishes and how that little boy fell off. That stool, I don't know, but he did he justice. No. Okay.
