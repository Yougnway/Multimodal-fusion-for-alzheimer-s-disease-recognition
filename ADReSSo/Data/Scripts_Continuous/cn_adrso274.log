Hi, the boy is taking a cookie out of a cookie jar and he has one in his left hand to reached out to give to us he hasn't in, his left hand, his sister or her girl is reaching up for a cookie and has her another index finger of a right hand pointed upward close to her mouth. And maybe she's saying she because they're gonna have to be quiet because the stool is, but it fall over. The boy has his right eel on his left toe. He wearing running shoes with pomp, palms on them, sounds like pretty sloppy.I observe that the one of the two first that the girl is wearing looks as if its soul is thicker than the one, the left one is thicker than the right. The woman is letting the sink run over the water is, running full tail down and overflowing the sink. She's drying a plate and she has a towel in her right hand. And if she has something else, all that's the curtain. Hank, the backs the end of the curtain behind her, the plate and her left hand. She's as her side, left side to the window. She's already dried a plate in two cubs. The window is open, and you can see the path outside going around, the left of the back of the house. And another room in the house. The window is also open, I believe. And she's standing with her. The woman is standing with her, put in the water, but not where it isn't the waters of sunning, another earth, clashing up the light, he was in the lawn, a puddle. That's what i've seen then in the kitchen.
