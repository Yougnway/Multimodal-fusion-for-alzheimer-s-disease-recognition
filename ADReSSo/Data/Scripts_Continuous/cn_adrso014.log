I see a woman who has zoned out. She's in the world of her own. Obviously, she'sn't aware of what's going on. Her son obviously is caught. Maybe it's not her son. Maybe she's just the the caretaker of the babysitter. And maybe that would give her a reason for being a little di se ng ag ed here. But at any rate, the boy is about to have an accident. He may very well pull the whole cookie jar down with him. And this woman is oblivious to the fact that the sink is running over. As soon as it gets ankle deep, I think she'll wake up. When she hears the crash, she definitely will be brought to uh, present. I'll be rise. It looks like a beautiful day out to height. Is there anything else? I should say about this picture?
