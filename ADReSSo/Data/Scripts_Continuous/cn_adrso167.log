I'd like you to do is just look at the picture and tell me anything at all that you see going. On children are getting into the, cookie jar. The little boy who's on the stew is about to fall, because the stew is going to pop all over. Mother has our back turned is drawing the dishes, but the sink is full of water, and the water is beginning to spill over onto the floor. Sink is in front of a window. One can look out the window and see a path. What is obviously a yard? There's a plate and 2 cups or dishes on the counter.The children getting into the cookie jar are one boy and one girl. Cookie jar is labeled cookie jar. The covered door is open. There are curtains at the kitchen window. The mother is wearing an apron. She had the sleepless dress in short hair. The little girl has straps on her shoes. The stool was a three legged stool.
