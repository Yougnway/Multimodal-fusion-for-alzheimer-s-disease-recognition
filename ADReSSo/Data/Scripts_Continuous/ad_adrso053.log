There it is cherish tilting. Let us off of the cookie jar, cooking and the left arm of the boy. His right hand is touching a cookie in the cookie jar. One of his foot, one of his feet is a hat on a third off as a stool. He got short pants and a blouse and a seat and a look like their boots instead of shoes. The girl added the finger to her lips as though to, say, quiet, they put one hand out. Her left hand is out.She's got a short skirt than a blouse, jersey sweater, socks, anklets rather on. I did mention that the store was tilting still on aboard the boy's down the store has and the tilting. I think I mentioned that the girl has hair hanged to her neck, the boy has like short like a hair comb straight back. The door, George open on the cupboard, the mothers dry on the dish. With a left hand, with the right hand, all of the left. She got an apron over her dress or whatever. Maybe water SP il li ng out of the sink. 2 cups face in off the direction. Once played to the right of the cups, curtains, flowing wind and breeze of the wind, there's so small buttons. That's about it is only thing.
